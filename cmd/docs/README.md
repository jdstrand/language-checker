# Autogenerated usage docs

This command is used to generate a markdown document that documents language-checker's usage.
It is currently used in conjunction with the GitHub action that auto-deploys the mkdocs documentation page.

**You would only need to run this command if you change some CLI option for license-checker and want to view the change locally when running the docs site**

## Running

```bash
# running from root of repo
go run cmd/docs/main.go <output_dir>

# this command will create a file `docs/snippets/license-checker.md`
go run cmd/docs/main.go docs/snippets
```
